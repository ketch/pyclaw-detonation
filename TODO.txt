List of things to do:

- Get a working version of shock_frame_1D
- Write data for lab_frame_2D solver in a format that a software like
paraview can read
- Implement entropy fix in the 2D solver
- Check that the entropy fix in the 1D solver is working fine (need
some test case for this). Entropy fixes are probably not important
when studying the stability of the ZND waves, but they might be
important in other situations
- Pass function handle omega to steadyStates instead of defining it 
inside
- Add the other things "to do" in this list
